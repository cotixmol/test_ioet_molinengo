<h2>Show the amount of times employees match at office</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> It was requested to develop an application able to identify the number of times to persons share the same time in an office in a week. As source of this data we use a .txt file named "employees.txt" with the following structure:</p>

`[ { "id":"1", "name": "RENE", "monday": "10:00-12:00", "tuesday": "10:00-12:00", "wednesday": "", "thursday": "01:00-03:00", "friday": "", "saturday": "14:00-18:00", "sunday": "20:00-21:00" } ]`
